# Post-Preview-card
Post Card Wordpress Plugin

### Example
Post Card -> https://tinyurl.com/m9hxqgl

## Description

This plugin installs 2 new widgets that preview a post in card shape. It is perfect for Page Builders like [Elementor](https://wordpress.org/plugins/elementor/) 
This page builders sometimes lack in functionalities to dynamicaly preview a post wherever you want. If you feel this too, this plugin is perfect for you as it is going to add 2 widgets:
*	Single Post by ID: This widget preview the post with the ID you inserted. 
*	Random Post by Category: This widget preview a random post using the category you inserted.
One additional functionality this plugin does is adding a 'Post Id' column to your 'All Posts' section on the admin panel, so you can easily pick the post id you wish. 

### Beatiful Layout
Both widgets have the same layout that consists:
*	Thumbnail of the featured image. If you don't have one it is going to display a default image so we Encourage you to always add a Featured image for the posts you want to be shown.
*	Publish date and Category.
*	Post Title. The full post title will be shown
*	Call Text. What we call Call text is a text where you write something to call the users attention. If you don't insert nothing, the Post Excerpt will be used or if don't have it either, the first 85 letters of the Post content will be used.
*	A beatifull Read More button pointing to your Post Single Page.

More layout options and full customization is being developed, so you'll be able to choose from optionals layouts, colors, default images for posts without featured images or complete remove the feature image.
