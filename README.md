It was previously created to be a full Elementor widget but as Elementor isn't a API, it was decided to develop a full wordpress widget
but, the widget works perfectly with the Elementor Page Builder. 

Fell Free to adapt the widget in you own needs the code is all commented waiting for any improvment and customization.

What we are creating and you can help 
                                    -> Post Card not by id but by category and the widget would randomize the post;
                                    -> Fix the 16:9 ratio image problem (if you add a non 16:9 ratio featured image, you can experience                                          some styling mistakes);
                                    -> Custom Post Card size;
                                    -> WHATEVER YOU WANT, just code and let us know.;
 ---------------------------
 General Usage: Using Elementor Page Builder, simply click and drag the widget to wherever you want it, it is developed to be a 3 columns
