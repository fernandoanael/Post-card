Post Preview Card is a Plugin that adds 2 beatiful widgets which previews posts in card shape. Perfect for Page Builders  

== Description ==

This plugin installs 2 new widgets that preview a post in card shape. It is perfect for Page Builders like [Elementor](https://wordpress.org/plugins/elementor/) 
This page builders sometimes lack in functionalities to dynamicaly preview a post wherever you want. If you feel this too, this plugin is perfect for you as it is going to add 2 widgets:
*	Single Post by ID: This widget preview the post with the ID you inserted. 
*	Random Post by Category: This widget preview a random post using the category you inserted.
One additional functionality this plugin does is adding a 'Post Id' column to your 'All Posts' section on the admin panel, so you can easily pick the post id you wish. 

= Beatiful Layout =
Both widgets have the same layout that consists:
*	Thumbnail of the featured image. If you don't have one it is going to display a default image so we Encourage you to always add a Featured image for the posts you want to be shown.
*	Publish date and Category.
*	Post Title. The full post title will be shown
*	Call Text. What we call Call text is a text where you write something to call the users attention. If you don't insert nothing, the Post Excerpt will be used or if don't have it either, the first 85 letters of the Post content will be used.
*	A beatifull Read More button pointing to your Post Single Page.

More layout options and full customization is being developed, so you'll be able to choose from optionals layouts, colors, default images for posts without featured images or complete remove the feature image.

= Easy to Use = 
Using a Page Builder like [Elementor](https://wordpress.org/plugins/elementor/) simply drag and drop the widget you want.
*	Using the 'Single Post by ID': In the widget form insert the Id of the post you want to be previewed (If you don't know the ID, go to the 'All Posts' section on the Admin Panel and a new column containing the post id will be displayed). Then add a cool Call Text or left it empty and we will handle this for you.
*	Using the 'Random Post by Category': In the widget form choose the category you want from the dropdown. Only Categories with posts assigned will be displayed. As this widget will display random posts, you can not specify a call text, the widget will use the Post Excerpt or will user the firsts 85 letters from the post content. Note that if you delete a category or delete all the posts assigned to it, an error message will be displayed.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What Page Builders were tested with this plugin? =

We only tested this plugin with [Elementor](https://wordpress.org/plugins/elementor/) Page Builder because it is the most used and free plugin avaible. But as it is a simple Wordpress plugin, it should work fine with any others page builders.

= When does new layouts and customization options will be released? =

Both widget already has a cool layout but I know you should be able fully customize it, and we are working on it. But there's no release date yet. But it won't take long.

= My featured image is being renderized bigger than others =

The reason is you're not using a 16:9 ratio featured image, and the plugin can't change that.
